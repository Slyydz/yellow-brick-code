        <p class="bio">The Cowardly Lion is a character in the fictional Land of Oz created by American author L. Frank Baum. Since lions are supposed to be "The Kings of Beasts," the Cowardly Lion believes that his fear makes him inadequate. He does not understand that courage means acting in the face of fear, which he does frequently.</p>
