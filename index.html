                <h2>The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film</h2>
					<p>When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, Toto, are whisked away in their house to the magical land of Oz. They follow the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to meet the Wizard, and en route they meet a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) that needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley) missing a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. The wizard asks the group to bring him the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) to earn his help.</p>

					    <p>L. Frank Baum's beloved children's book "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" has been adapted in various forms over the years, but at this point we have no idea what version to expect from director Nicole Kassell.</p>

                        <p>Wraith talk. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Bless up. Congratulations, you played yourself. We the best. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.</p>

                        <p>In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. Stay focused. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh.</p>
